The project presents the findings and analysis of the Priority Scheduling with General Services project, which aimed to investigate and implement a 3-class priority scheduling for a M/D/1 queueing system with preemption-resume using OMNeT++ simulation platform. Initially, we define the topic briefly, followed by presenting the theoretical findings.
